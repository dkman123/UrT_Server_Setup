### create a start script

in the UrbanTerror43 I put a script to start ts3

**startts3.sh**
```
#!/bin/sh

# change to the TS3 folder
cd /home/urt/Documents/teamspeak3-server_linux_amd64

# remove the pid file, if any
rm ts3server.pid

# run TS3
# NOTE: it's script runs and exits, but leaves the TS3 server running. So we pop out without it dying
./ts3server_startscript.sh start
# only needed for first start
# license_accepted=1

```

Create the **stopts3.sh** file
```
#!/bin/sh

# change to the TS3 folder
cd /home/urt/Documents/teamspeak3-server_linux_amd64

# stop the TS3 server
./ts3server_startscript.sh stop
```

make the scripts executable
```
sudo chmod 774 startts3.sh
sudo chmod 774 stopts3.sh
```

NOTE: ctrl+c will NOT stop ts3

Set up the service to run ts3
> sudo featherpad /lib/systemd/system/ts3.service

Put the contents
