## B3
Big Brother Bot setup

download B3 zip from https://github.com/ptitbigorneau/BigBrotherBot-For-UrT43

or https://github.com/BigBrotherBot/big-brother-bot

NOTE: I used the first one, but it’s missing a folder I had to pull from the second, see below


For b3 commands see http://kzh.clankrh.com/b3/kzhzombie/commands.html

Or https://pingperfect.com/index.php/knowledgebase/94/B3-Commands.html

for B3 install mysql
```
sudo apt-get install mysql-server
sudo apt-get install python-mysqldb
```

start the service
> systemctl start mysql

launch at boot
> systemctl enable mysql

Launch the first time (if it says access denied, try with sudo. If it only works with sudo that’s a bug. See "to fix the mysql won’t connect unless i sudo it", but you can wait to fix it until that point)

To fix the issue where mysql won’t connect unless you sudo it

connect to mysql (replace {NEWPASSWORD} with the password you want to set)
```
sudo mysql -u root

SELECT User, Host FROM mysql.user;
DROP USER 'root'@'localhost';
CREATE USER 'root'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY '{NEWPASSWORD}';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'root'@'%' WITH GRANT OPTION;
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

run mysql
> /usr/bin/mysql -u root -p

NOTE: to stop the service
> systemctl stop mysql

NOTE: to start the service
> systemctl start mysql

change folder
> cd ~/Documents/B3/BigBrotherBot-For-UrT43-master/b3/sql/mysql

get into mysql
> sudo mysql -u root -p

run these in this order to set up the database (in this order)
```
source b3-db.sql
use b3;
source b3.sql
source b3-update-1.3.0.sql
source b3-update-1.6.0.sql
source b3-update-1.7.0.sql
source b3-update-1.8.1.sql
source b3-update-1.9.0.sql
source b3-update-1.10.0.sql
UPDATE mysql.user SET authentication_string=PASSWORD('{NEWPASSWORD}') WHERE User='b3';
```

in server.cfg (settings for B3)
```
set g_logsync "2"    // 0=no log, 1=buffered, 2=continuous, 3=append
set g_loghits "0"    // log hits 1 allows b3 to recognize headshots and xlrstats to provide hit location statistics (makes much bigger logs, might not be needed)
//You might want to log every bullet hit to the game log file in order for B3 to work with plugins such as XLRstats.
  set sv_minrate “25000” // to have stable pings and have B3 work smoothly
```

b3 usergroups

Lvl | keyword
--- | -------
100 | superadmin
 80 | senioradmin
 60 | fulladmin
 40 | admin
 20 | mod
  2 | reg
  1 | user
  0 | guest

NOTE: in addons you can set the levels that can run commands (in the main system too)

build B3 (from install.rst)
```
cd ~/Documents/B3/BigBrotherBot-For-UrT43-master
python setup.py build
sudo python setup.py install
```
NOTE: goes to usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages

Run it once to make it create the config directory
> /usr/local/bin/b3_run

----

Creating a b3 config file (named b3.xml or b3.ini)

you can grab the sample b3.ini file in this repo or generate one by:
```
grab b3 config generator from https://github.com/ozguruysal/b3-config-generator
I set up WAMP on windows
download from http://www.wampserver.com/
tossed the generator files into the www folder
visited http://localhost/b3-config-generator-master/
the generator page option only went up to UrT 4.2, but that’s ok for now
downloaded b3.ini
```
put the ini into /home/urt/.b3/b3.ini

change the parser to 
> parser: iourt43
change the database user and password (note: i set them wrong or didn’t set them on the generator)

copy the plugin config files 
> cp ~/Documents/B3/BigBrotherBot-For-UrT43-master/b3/conf /home/urt/.b3

in the UrbanTerror43 I put a script to start b3
**startb3.sh**
```
#!/bin/bash

# run server
/usr/local/bin/b3_run
```

NOTE: ctrl+c will stop b3

run the game (become the super admin, 1st player to type this gets it - so DO IT NOW)
> !iamgod

mysql tip: if you get error Table '{tablename}' is marked as crashed and should be repaired
> mysqlcheck -uroot -p --repair --all-databases

----
Unnecessary steps I'm just including in case something comes up again.


~~hit enter as an empty password to get in~~

~~if that doesn’t work, force set the password~~
> sudo mysqladmin -u root password NEWPASSWORD

~~if that doesn’t work make a file MysqlReset.sql (replace {NEWPASSWORD}):~~
> UPDATE mysql.user SET authentication_string=PASSWORD('{NEWPASSWORD}') WHERE User='root';

~~then manually start mysqld with~~
> sudo mysqld --init-file=FullPathToMysqlReset.sql

stop the service
> systemctl stop mysql

start the service
> systemctl start mysql

~~b3 1st run setup (from first_run.rst)~~
> cd ~/Documents/B3/BigBrotherBot-For-UrT43-master
~~*#python ./b3_run.py*~~
> /usr/local/bin/b3_run
~~errors on no config~~

#Not needed: sudo apt install python-pip
#Not needed: pip install GeoIP
#I don’t think this was needed either
> sudo apt install python-geoip*


#I’m not sure that this was necessary

cd /usr/local/share
sudo mkdir GeoIP

possibly DL file from https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geoip2/geolite2/
but i had an older GeoIP.dat file that I sent up to the server Desktop
> sudo cp ~/Desktop/GeoIP.dat .
an old dat can also be found in older b3 github*
```

NOTE: To get a Python library location
```
import geoip
print ( geoip.__file__ )
