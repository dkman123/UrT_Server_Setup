## B3
Big Brother Bot setup

~~download B3 zip from https://github.com/ptitbigorneau/BigBrotherBot-For-UrT43~~

~~or https://github.com/BigBrotherBot/big-brother-bot~~

~~NOTE: I used the first one, but it’s missing a folder I had to pull from the second, see below~~

download B3 zip from https://github.com/dkman123/BigBrotherBot-For-UrT43

For b3 commands see http://kzh.clankrh.com/b3/kzhzombie/commands.html

Or https://pingperfect.com/index.php/knowledgebase/94/B3-Commands.html

install prereq mysql
```
sudo apt-get install mysql-server
sudo apt-get install python-mysqldb
sudo apt-get install python-pymysql
```

On 20.04 python-mysqldb is not available any more. To get it you can add the older repo
```
sudo add-apt-repository 'deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu bionic main'
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y python-mysqldb
```

start the service
> sudo systemctl start mysql

launch at boot
> sudo systemctl enable mysql

Launch the first time (if it says access denied, try with sudo. If it only works with sudo that’s a bug. See "to fix the mysql won’t connect unless i sudo it", but you can wait to fix it until that point)

To fix the issue where mysql won’t connect unless you sudo it

connect to mysql (replace **{NEWPASSWORD}** with the password you want to set)
```
sudo mysql -u root

SELECT User, Host FROM mysql.user;
DROP USER 'root'@'localhost';
CREATE USER 'root'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY '{NEWPASSWORD}';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'root'@'%' WITH GRANT OPTION;
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```
*if you screw that up and don't replace the password make sure you replace 'localhost' with '%' on the drop user statement*

to get out type 
> quit;

note: you might want to create a backup user in case something blows up with the root user

run mysql (it lives in /usr/bin/mysql)
> mysql -u root -p

NOTE: to stop the service
> sudo systemctl stop mysql

NOTE: to start the service
> sudo systemctl start mysql

extract the zip for B3. (see download link at the top)

use built in archive software to unzip to ~/Documents

change folder (assuming folder name BigBrotherBot-For-UrT43-master)
> cd ~/Documents/BigBrotherBot-For-UrT43-master/b3/sql/mysql

get into mysql
> sudo mysql -u root -p

run these in this order to set up the database (in this order)
```
source b3-db.sql
use b3;
source b3.sql
source b3-update-1.3.0.sql
source b3-update-1.6.0.sql
source b3-update-1.7.0.sql
source b3-update-1.8.1.sql
source b3-update-1.9.0.sql
source b3-update-1.10.0.sql
source iso_body.sql
source iso_weapon.sql
source ../../extplugins/mapconfig/sql/b3_mapconfig-1.2.1.sql
source ../../extplugins/mapconfig/sql/b3_mapconfig-1.2.2.sql
source ../../extplugins/mapconfig/sql/b3_mapconfig-1.2.3.sql
UPDATE mysql.user SET authentication_string=PASSWORD('{NEWPASSWORD}') WHERE User='b3';
```

if you have a Failed to Connect to DB error when running B3 you can test the login
> mysql -u b3 -p b3

(-u b3 is specifying the user. -p says prompt for a password. the b3 at the end is the database to connect to)

optional
```
source ../../extplugins/mapconfig/sql/b3_mapconfig_LotsOfMaps.sql
```

quit out
> quit;

edit UrT server.cfg
> featherpad ~/Documents/UrbanTerror43/q3ut4/server.cfg

in server.cfg (settings for B3)
```
set g_logsync "2"    // 0=no log, 1=buffered, 2=continuous, 3=append
set g_loghits "0"    // log hits 1 allows b3 to recognize headshots and xlrstats to provide hit location statistics (makes much bigger logs, might not be needed)
//You might want to log every bullet hit to the game log file in order for B3 to work with plugins such as XLRstats.
  set sv_minrate “25000” // to have stable pings and have B3 work smoothly
```

b3 usergroups

Lvl | keyword
--- | -------
100 | superadmin
 80 | senioradmin
 60 | fulladmin
 40 | admin
 20 | mod
  2 | reg
  1 | user
  0 | guest

NOTE: in addons you can set the levels that can run commands (in the main system too)

build B3 (from install.rst)
```
cd ~/Documents/BigBrotherBot-For-UrT43-master
python setup.py build
sudo python setup.py install
```
NOTE: the files go to /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages

Run it once to make it create the config directory
> /usr/local/bin/b3_run

copy the plugin config files 
> cp ~/Documents/BigBrotherBot-For-UrT43-master/b3/conf/* ~/.b3

----

A *b3.ini* file was added to this repo so you can use that as a template.  Take that and edit it.

Save the b3.ini into ~/.b3

	Or, the following is how to create a new one.

	Creating a b3 config file (named b3.xml or b3.ini)

	you can grab the sample b3.ini file in this repo or generate one by:
	```
	grab b3 config generator from https://github.com/ozguruysal/b3-config-generator
	I set up WAMP on windows
	download from http://www.wampserver.com/
	tossed the generator files into the www folder
	visited http://localhost/b3-config-generator-master/
	the generator page option only went up to UrT 4.2, but that’s ok for now
	downloaded b3.ini
	```
	put the ini into /home/urt/.b3/b3.ini

	change the parser to 
	> parser: iourt43

Edit the b3.ini file

Set the database user and password. Also set your external server IP and rcon password.

-----

create a start b3 script
```
cd ~/Documents/UrbanTerror43
featherpad ./startb3.sh
```

i put all of the start scripts in the UrbanTerror43 for sanity's sake

**startb3.sh**
```
#!/bin/sh

# swtich to base folder (where we want the pid file)
cd /home/urt/Documents/UrbanTerror43


# b3 config folder
conf=/home/urt/.b3

# get the pid for that instance, filter out the pid for this awk command
pid=`ps ux | awk '/b3_run/ && !/awk/ {print $2}'`

# -n = if string is not null
if [ -n "$pid" ]; then
  echo "A B3 server with is already running!"
else
  echo "Starting B3 Server..."
  # sets new files permissions to -rw-r-----
  umask 0026
  # create the file and timestamp it
  touch b3.pid
  # set shell resource limits
  ulimit -c unlimited

  # remove old log files (mtime is days)
  find $conf/logs -type f -name '*.log' -mtime +30 -exec rm {} \;

  # rename the old log file
  if [ -e "$conf/b3.log" ]; then
    # rename the file appending a last modified timestamp
    mv -f "$conf/b3.log" "$conf/logs/b3.$(stat --printf='%Y' $conf/b3.log).log"
  fi
  
  while true
  do
  
    # -e = if file exists
    if [ -e "b3.pid" ]; then
      
		# run server
		/usr/local/bin/b3_run
		# to specify a config file run with -c /home/urt/.b3/b3.ini
     
    else
      exit 0
    fi
  done
fi

```

create a script to stop b3 (for when we make it a service)

**stopb3.sh**
```
#!/bin/sh

# swtich to base folder (where we want the pid file)
cd /home/urt/Documents/UrbanTerror43

echo "Finding B3 process..."
# get the pid for that instance, filter out the pid for this awk command
pid=`ps ux | awk '/b3_run/ && !/awk/ {print $2}'`

# -n = if string is not null
if [ -n "$pid" ]; then
  # remove the file
  rm b3.pid
  echo "Killing B3 process: $pid"
  # end the process
  kill $pid
  # check to make sure
  pid=`ps ux | awk '/b3_run/ && !/awk/ {print $2}'`
  # -n = if string is not null
  if [ -n "$pid" ]; then
    # wait 2 seconds
    sleep 2
    # check again
    pid=`ps ux | awk '/b3_run/ && !/awk/ {print $2}'`
    # if it's still running
    if [ -n "$pid" ]; then
      # force close the process
      kill -9 $pid
    fi
  fi
else
  # it wasn't running
  echo "Could not find a server process for B3"
fi
```

make the scripts executable
```
chmod 774 startb3.sh
chmod 774 stopb3.sh
```

NOTE: ctrl+c will stop b3

Set up the service to run B3
> sudo featherpad /lib/systemd/system/b3.service

Put the contents
```
[Unit]
Description=B3 systemd service.
Wants=network-online.target
After=syslog.target network.target urt.target mysql.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=urt
Group=urt
ExecStart=/bin/sh /home/urt/Documents/UrbanTerror43/startb3.sh
ExecStop=/bin/sh /home/urt/Documents/UrbanTerror43/stopb3.sh

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Start the service
> sudo systemctl start b3

To stop it
> sudo systemctl stop b3

To see if it's running or not
> sudo systemctl status b3

Set it to start automatically when the system restarts
> sudo systemctl enable b3

run the game (become the super admin, 1st player to type this gets it - so DO IT NOW)
> !iamgod

mysql tip: if you get error Table '{tablename}' is marked as crashed and should be repaired
> mysqlcheck -uroot -p --repair --all-databases

it might even be worth creating a script file repairMysql.sh
```
!/bin/bash
mysqlcheck -uroot -p --repair --all-databases
```

go to the .b3 folder and create a logs folder
```
cd /home/urt/.b3
mkdir logs
```

Done.

NOTE: In the ~/.b3 folder there is a b3_doc.html

You can put this on a web server so people can browse what functions they have access to, or what functions are enabled on the server.

It builds this file every time B3 starts, so it is always current.

NOTE: If the site is using https://
> sudo featherpad  /var/www/html/info/b3_doc.html

Search and replace http:// with https://

Save and Exit

----

If you want to run multiple game servers on the same machine you can, just change the port.

To run multiple b3 create additional databases. I suggest you use different database users and passwords so they can't accidently touch eachother.

open b3-db.sql in an editor and enter the commands manually to create a new database. (the first line above)

You can run the other source files as they are

Set the password for the new user manually (the last line above)

Copy the ~/.b3 folder to a new folder
> cp -r /home/urt/.b3 /home/urt/.b3Small

Edit the ini file to read from the correct game.log, touch the correct db, etc

For the startup it look at the command name (the executable), so copy the executable for the new "copy" of b3
> sudo cp /usr/local/bin/b3_run /usr/local/bin/b3s_run

Create a startup script to run this new executable and specify the b3 ini file

You can create a new game in echelon and a new server for that game.

## Unnecessary steps I'm just including in case something comes up again.


~~Move the geolocation plugin~~
> cd /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/b3-1.12-py2.7.egg/b3/extplugins
~~Copy the folder~~
> sudo cp -r ../plugins/geolocation .

~~hit enter as an empty password to get in~~

~~if that doesn’t work, force set the password~~
> sudo mysqladmin -u root password NEWPASSWORD

~~if that doesn’t work make a file MysqlReset.sql (replace {NEWPASSWORD}):~~
> UPDATE mysql.user SET authentication_string=PASSWORD('{NEWPASSWORD}') WHERE User='root';

~~then manually start mysqld with~~
> sudo mysqld --init-file=FullPathToMysqlReset.sql

~~stop the service~~
> systemctl stop mysql

~~start the service~~
> systemctl start mysql

~~b3 1st run setup (from first_run.rst)~~
> cd ~/Documents/B3/BigBrotherBot-For-UrT43-master
~~*#python ./b3_run.py*~~
